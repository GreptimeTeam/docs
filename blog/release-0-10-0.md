# v0.10.0

Release date: November 22, 2024

## üëç Highlights

* [Vector type](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/vectors/vector-type): GreptimeDB supports vector data types to optimize edge scenarios, such as IoT in vehicles, enabling efficient storage and computation of vector data for real-time perception and AI applications in smart driving.
* [Free index](https://docs.greptime.com/reference/sql/create#inverted-index): Inverted indexes are no longer tied to primary keys, allowing users to create them on any column, enhancing query flexibility and efficiency across different scenarios.
* [Alter table options](https://docs.greptime.com/reference/sql/alter): Enhancements include setting TTL for databases and tables, modifying compaction parameters, and enabling/disabling full-text indexes on columns.
* Loki remote write: GreptimeDB now supports the Loki remote write protocol, allowing users to log data in Loki format through Grafana tools.
* Performance Optimization: Up to 10x improvement for queries fetching the latest N records by timestamp (`ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT N`).
