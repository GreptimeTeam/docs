# v0.15.0

Release date: July 04, 2025

**It is recommended to upgrade to [v0.15.1](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/releases/tag/v0.15.1)**

### 👍 Highlights

- **Process Management**: Implements complete process management system with `ProcessManager`,
`information_schema.process_list` table, process killing functionality, and MySQL client
`Ctrl+C` support for query termination (#5865, #6309, #6320).

- **Bulk Insert Performance**: Introducing `SimpleBulkMemtable` for tables without primary keys to
accelerate bulk write operations (#6054).

- **Partition Rule Checker**: Introduces a robust point matrix-based partition rule checker that
ensures completeness and uniqueness, eliminating false negatives and providing better error
messages with specific uncovered/overlapped value ranges (#6431).

- **Pipeline Integration**: Adds pipeline support for Prometheus remote write and
Loki API (#5981, #6390).

- **VRL Processing**: Introduces Vector Remap Language (VRL) processor for advanced data
transformation within pipelines, allowing users to write VRL scripts for flexible data
processing (#6205).
