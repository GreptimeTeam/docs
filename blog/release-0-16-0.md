# v0.16.0

Release date: August 06, 2025

### üëç Highlights

- **Automated Metadata Reconciliation**: Introduces reconcile procedures for catalogs, databases, tables to keep metadata consistent (#6613, #6612, #6584, #6588, #6614).

- **TQL in CTE**: Allows embedding PromQL inside SQL queries (#6645), e.g.:

    ```sql
    WITH prom_result AS (
        TQL EVAL (0, 100, '10s') sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) BY (job)
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM prom_result
    ORDER BY sum_rate_http_requests_total_5m
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

- **PromQL**: Introduces the `absent()` function for detecting missing series (#6618).

- **Observability Improvements**: Provides a panic logger, HTTP API to toggle heap profiling (enabled by default), and more verbose logs/metrics in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE` (#6633, #6593, #6575).
