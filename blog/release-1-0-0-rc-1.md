# v1.0.0-rc.1

Release date: February 02, 2026

### 👍 Highlights

**Region Repartition**
RC.1 introduces **Region Repartition**, allowing users to dynamically adjust partition rules and redistribute data at runtime, without rebuilding tables or performing manual migrations.

* **Split Partitions**
Split a large or hotspot partition into multiple smaller ones:
```sql
ALTER TABLE sensor_readings SPLIT PARTITION (
  device_id < 100
) INTO (
  device_id < 100 AND area < 'South',
  device_id < 100 AND area >= 'South'
);
```

* **Merge Partitions**
Merge multiple small partitions into a single one:
```sql
ALTER TABLE sensor_readings MERGE PARTITION (
  device_id < 100 AND area < 'South',
  device_id < 100 AND area >= 'South'
);
```

* **Execution Control with WITH Clause**
Users can control procedure behavior via `WITH` options:
```sql
ALTER TABLE sensor_readings SPLIT PARTITION (
  device_id < 100
) INTO (
  device_id < 100 AND area < 'South',
  device_id < 100 AND area >= 'South'
) WITH (
  TIMEOUT = '5m',
  WAIT = false
);
```

 * When `WAIT = false`, the statement returns immediately with a `procedure_id`.
Progress can be checked via `ADMIN procedure_state(procedure_id)`;
 * TIMEOUT sets an overall time limit for the operation.

**Note:** Region repartitioning is currently supported only when:
 * Running in distributed cluster mode
 * Using object storage and GC are enabled

**Metric Engine Primary Key Filter Acceleration**

RC.1 introduces a fast-path optimization for primary key filtering in the Metric Engine.
Instead of decoding and materializing values row by row, the engine now performs direct comparisons on **memcomparable-encoded primary key bytes**, significantly reducing CPU overhead.
 * Dense codec: 20–90× faster
 * Sparse codec: 3–11× faster

This improvement greatly boosts query performance for high-cardinality metric workloads.

### Breaking changes

* feat!: make heartbeat config only in metasrv by [@fengjiachun](https://github.com/fengjiachun) in [#7510](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/7510)

### ⚠️ Compatibility notice

* refactor: remove `region_numbers` from `TableMeta` and `TableInfo` by [@WenyXu](https://github.com/WenyXu) in [#7519](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/7519)

In the new version, the `TableMeta.region_numbers` field has been removed.
As older versions still depend on this field, downgrading from the new version to an older version may introduce compatibility issues. Specifically, an older version may fail or throw errors when reading data generated by the new version, since the `region_numbers` field is no longer present.
