# v0.11.2

Release date: January 04, 2025


This version fixes the following critical issues:
- Automatic alteration of the table may lead to inconsistent metadata.
- Compaction doesn't use files in the local cache.


### Notes
This version modifies the default object storage cache paths:
- The path for write cache has changed from the default `{data_home}/object_cache/write` to `{data_home}/cache/object/write`.
- The path for read cache has changed from the default `{data_home}/object_cache/read` to `{data_home}/cache/object/read`.
- When configuring write cache and read cache, only the root directory of the cache needs to be specified, which defaults to `{data_home}`.


We recommend that users no longer manually configure the cache paths after version 0.11, as the database can automatically set appropriate paths.
