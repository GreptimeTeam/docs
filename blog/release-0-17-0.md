# v0.17.0

Release date: September 03, 2025

### üö® Breaking Changes

- **Ordered-set aggregate functions**  
  - Now require a `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ‚Ä¶)` clause (e.g., old: `approx_percentile_cont(latency, 0.95)`, new: `approx_percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY latency)`).
- **MySQL protocol**  
  - Incorrect comment styling is no longer allowed; comments must start with `--` instead of `---`.

### üëç Highlights

- **Flow Support TQL(PromQL):**
  - TQL (Time Query Language) now integrates seamlessly with Flow, enabling advanced time-series computations such as rate calculations, moving averages, and other complex time-window operations. For more details, see [Using TQL with Flow for Advanced Time-Series Analysis](/user-guide/flow-computation/continuous-aggregation/#using-tql-with-flow-for-advanced-time-series-analysis).
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize sparse encoder with a 235% performance boost ([#6809](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6809))
  - Introduced region pruning ([#6729](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6729), [#6752](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6752)).
- **Procedure:**
  - Introduced table reconciliation procedures to automatically detect and repair metadata inconsistencies between Metasrv and Datanode. For more information, refer to the [table reconciliation documentation](/user-guide/deployments-administration/maintenance/table-reconciliation/).
- **Remote WAL:**
  - Replace offset-based remote WAL pruning with size-based pruning strategy and other optimizations ([#6730](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6730), [#6732](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6732), [#6741](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6741), [#6782](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6782), [#6816](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6816), [#6856](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/6856)).
