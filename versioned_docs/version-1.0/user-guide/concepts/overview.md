# Concepts

GreptimeDB is an observability database that unifies metrics, logs, and traces in a single engine. This section covers the core concepts you need to understand how GreptimeDB works and why it's designed this way.

**Start here:**
- [Why GreptimeDB](./why-greptimedb.md) — The problem with three-pillar observability stacks, and how GreptimeDB solves it
- [Data Model](./data-model.md) — How metrics, logs, and traces are represented as timestamped events with tags and fields
- [Architecture](./architecture.md) — Compute-storage separation, stateless frontends, and how GreptimeDB scales

**Deep dives:**
- [Observability 2.0](./observability-2.md) — Wide events, unified data model, and the evolution beyond three pillars
- [Storage Location](./storage-location.md) — Object storage, local disk, and multi-engine storage options
- [Key Concepts](./key-concepts.md) — Tables, regions, time index, data types, views, and flows
- [Common Questions](./features-that-you-concern.md) — FAQ on updates, deletions, TTL, compression, high cardinality, and more
