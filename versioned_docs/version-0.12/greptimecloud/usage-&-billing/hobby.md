# Hobby Plan

## Introduction

GreptimeCloud offers a free tier Hobby Plan for users to try the service.
Each team can create up to three services in the Hobby Plan.

The Hobby Plan has the following limitations:

- RCU (Read Capacity Units): 40 RCU/s per service.
- WCU (Write Capacity Units): 20 WCU/s per service.
- Storage capacity: 5GB per service.
- Data retention policy: 3 months.

:::tip NOTE
The plan may change in the future. If you have any questions about it, please contact [feedback@greptime.cloud](mailto:feedback@greptime.cloud).

<!-- ## Upgrade to Serverless Plan or Dedicated Plan

When the usage of a service exceeds the Hobby Plan limits, you can upgrade to the [Serverless Plan](./serverless.md) or [Dedicated Plan](./dedicated.md) to get more resources.

In the [GreptimeCloud Console](https://console.greptime.cloud/), click `Upgrade` on the service details page and choose the suitable plan. -->
