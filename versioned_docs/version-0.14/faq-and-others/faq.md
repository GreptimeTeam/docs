# Frequently Asked Questions

### How is GreptimeDB's performance compared to other solutions?

Please read [How is GreptimeDB's performance compared to other solutions](/user-guide/concepts/features-that-you-concern#how-is-greptimedbs-performance-compared-to-other-solutions).

### How does this compare to Loki? Is there a crate with Rust bindings available, preferably as a tracing or logging subscriber?

GreptimeDB now supports log data types and has introduced compatibility with various industry protocols in version 0.10. These include Loki Remote Write, Vector plugins, and the full range of OTLP data types (Metrics, Traces, Logs).

We plan to further refine the log engine, focusing on improving query performance and user experience. Future enhancements will include (but are not limited to) extending the functionality of GreptimeDB's log query DSL and implementing compatibility with some Elasticsearch/Loki APIs, providing users with more efficient and flexible log query capabilities.

For more information about using GreptimeDB with logs, refer to the documentation:
- [Log Overview](/user-guide/logs/overview.md)
- [OpenTelemetry compatibility](/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/opentelemetry.md)
- [Loki protocol compatibility](/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/loki.md)
- [Vector compatibility](/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/vector.md)

### What would be the use cases for a time-series database?

Common use cases for time-series database include but are not limited to the following four scenarios:

1. Monitor applications and infrastructure
2. Store and access IoT data
3. Process self-driving vehicle data
4. Understand financial trends

### Does GreptimeDB have a Go driver?

Yes, you can find our Go SDK [here](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb-ingester-go).

### When will GreptimeDB release its first GA version?

We expect to release the GA version this June. For detailed plans, please refer to: [GreptimeDB 2025 Roadmap Released!](https://greptime.com/blogs/2025-02-06-greptimedb-roadmap2025)

### Are there any plans/works done for the official UI for GreptimeDB so that it would be possible to check cluster status, list of tables, statistics etc?

Yes, we open sourced the dashboard for users to query and visualize their data.

Please check out our initial version on [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/dashboard).

### Can GreptimeDB be used as a Rust alternative to Prometheus in the observable area?

GreptimeDB has implemented native support for PromQL, with over 90% compatibility that can cover most common usage requirement. We are keeping making it comparable to VictoriaMetrics.

### Is GreptimeDB compatible with Grafana?

Yes, It's compatible with Grafana.

GreptimeDB has an official Grafana plugin: [greptimedb-grafana-datasource](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb-grafana-datasource/)

GreptimeDB also supports MySQL and PostgreSQL protocol, so you can use [MySQL or PG grafana plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/mysql/) to config GreptimeDB as a datasource. Then you can use SQL to query the data.

Also, we are implementing PromQL natively which is frequently used with Grafana.

### How is the performance of GreptimeDB when used for non-time-series DB tables?

GreptimeDB supports SQL and can deal with non-time-series data, especially efficient for high concurrent and throughput data writing. However, we develop GreptimeDB for a specific domain (Iot and Observerbility scenarios), and it doesn't support transactions and can't delete data efficiently.

### Is there any retention policy? 

GreptimeDB supports both database-level and table-level TTLs. By default, a table inherits the TTL of its database. However, if a table is assigned a specific TTL, the table-level TTL takes precedence. For details, refer to the official documentation on TTL: [TTL Syntax Documentation](/reference/sql/create.md).

### Where’s the name “Greptime” coming from?

Because `grep` is the most useful command line tool on \*nix platform to search data, and time means time series. So Greptime is to help everybody to search/find value in time series data.

### Does GreptimeDB support schemaless?

Yes, GreptimeDB is a schemaless database without need for creating tables in advance. The table and columns will be created automatically when writing data with protocol gRPC, InfluxDB Line Protocol, OpenTSDB, Prometheus Remote Write.

### Does GreptimeDB support dumping table-level data to S3?

You can use the [`COPY TO` command](/reference/sql/copy.md#s3) to dump table-level data to S3.

### Can GreptimeDB be used for a large-scale internal metrics collection system similar to Fb's Gorilla or Google's Monarch, with a preference for in-memory data and high availability? Are there plans for asynchronous WAL or optional disk storage, and how is data replication handled without WAL?

GreptimeDB supports asynchronous WAL and is developing a per-table WAL toggle for more control. A tiered storage approach, starting with in-memory caching, is also in development. For data replication, data flushed to remote stores like S3 is replicated independently of WAL. For more about the details of tiered storage, please read the [blog](https://greptime.com/blogs/2025-03-26-greptimedb-storage-architecture).

### If I delete the database, can I use the `DROP DATABASE` command?

Yes. You can refer to the official documentation for usage: [`Drop Database`](/reference/sql/drop.md#drop).

### What are the main differences between Greptime and another time-series database built on DataFusion like InfluxDB?

At GreptimeDB, we share some technical similarities with InfluxDB, both using Datafusion, Arrow, Parquet, and built on object storage. However, we differ in several key aspects:

- **Open-Source Strategy**: Unlike InfluxDB, which only open-sources its standalone version, our entire distributed cluster version is open-source. Our architecture can even run on edge Android systems.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Our architecture is more aligned with HBase's Region/RegionServer design. Our Write-Ahead Log (WAL) uses Kafka, and we're exploring a quorum-based implementation in the future.
- **Workload and Services**: We specialize in handling various types of observability data—including metrics, logs, traces, and events—while seamlessly integrating them with analytical workloads. This integration aims to enhance resource efficiency and real-time performance for users. We also offer [GreptimeCloud](https://greptime.com/product/cloud), a commercial cloud service.
- **Storage Engine Design**: Our pluggable storage engine is versatile. For scenarios with many small data tables, like in Prometheus, we have a dedicated Metrics storage engine.
- **Query Language Support**: We support PromQL for observability and SQL for data analysis, and incorporate Python for complex data processing. InfluxDB, on the other hand, uses InfluxQL and SQL.

We're a young, rapidly evolving project and always looking to improve. For more details, visit [our Blog](https://greptime.com/blogs/) and [Contributor Guide](/contributor-guide/overview). We welcome your interest and contributions!

### As a first-timer looking to contribute to GreptimeDB, where can I find a comprehensive guide to get started?

Welcome! Please refer to our [contribution guide](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). For those new to GreptimeDB, we have a selected collection of [good first issues](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22). Feel free to reach us in Slack channel anytime!

### Does GreptimeDB have a way to handle absolute counters that can reset, like InfluxDB's non-negative differential? How do aggregations work with these counters, and is PromQL preferred over SQL for them? Also, is there a plan to integrate PromQL functions into SQL, similar to InfluxDB v3?

GreptimeDB, like Prometheus, handles counters effectively. Functions like` reset()`, `rate()`, or `delta()` in GreptimeDB are designed to automatically detect and adjust for counter resets. While it's not recommended to use the `deriv()` function on a counter since it's meant for gauges, you can apply `rate()` to your counter and then use `deriv()`. PromQL is indeed more suitable for operations involving counters, given its origin in Prometheus. However, we are exploring the integration of PromQL functions into SQL for greater flexibility. If you're interested in implementing functions into GreptimeDB, we have documentation available which you can check out: [Greptime Documentation](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/blob/main/docs/how-to/how-to-write-aggregate-function.md).

### What are the feature differences between the open-source version and the cloud version of GreptimeDB?

Below are some key points:

- **Foundational Features**: The foundational features, including the ingestion protocol, SQL capabilities, and storage functions, are largely identical between the two versions. However, GreptimeCloud offers advanced SQL functions and additional features.
- **Fully Managed Service**: GreptimeCloud is a fully managed service that supports multi-tenancy, data encryption, and security audits for compliance, which are not available in the open-source version. GreptimeCloud supports dedicated deployments as well as a pay-as-you-go serverless model.
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Another significant advantage of GreptimeCloud is its superior dashboard, which is more user-friendly and includes a unique Prometheus workbench. This workbench facilitates online editing of Prometheus dashboards and alert rules, as well as GitOps integration.

As mentioned, the cloud version offers more ready-to-use features to help you get started quickly. The core features are almost identical, especially on our dedicated plan.

### Where can I find documentation related to on-premises deployment and performance benchmark reports?

You can find the public TSBS benchmark results [here](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/tree/main/docs/benchmarks/tsbs) and the deployment documentation [here](/getting-started/installation/overview.md).

For more about performance reports please read [How is GreptimeDB's performance compared to other solutions?](/user-guide/concepts/features-that-you-concern.md#how-is-greptimedbs-performance-compared-to-other-solutions)


### What should I do if the region becomes `DOWNGRADED` and the tables on that node become read-only after the datanode restarts? Is there a way to automatically reactivate it?

According to your configuration, the failover in metasrv, which may mark the region as `DOWNGRADED`, is disabled. Another procedure that may mark a region as `DOWNGRADED` is the region migration procedure. Please try running the region migration procedure and provide feedback for further assistance.

### Is there a guide or suggestions for compiling GreptimeDB into a standalone binary with only the necessary modules and features for an embedded environment?

We have prebuilt binaries for Android ARM64 platforms, which have been successfully used in some enterprise projects. However, these binaries are not available for bare metal devices, as some fundamental components of GreptimeDB require a standard library.

### Is there a built-in SQL command like `compaction table t1` that can be used for manual compaction?

Please refer [here](/reference/sql/admin.md).

### Can GreptimeDB be used to store logs?

Yes, please refer [here](/user-guide/logs/overview.md ) for detailed information.

### How is the query performance for non-primary key fields? Can inverted indexes be set? Will the storage cost be lower compared to Elasticsearch?

Non-primary key fields can also have indexes created. For details, refer to [Index Management](/user-guide/manage-data/data-index.md).

GreptimeDB's storage cost is significantly lower than Elasticsearch, with the size of persisted data being only 50% of ClickHouse and 12.7% of Elasticsearch. For more information, see the [Performance Benchmark](https://greptime.com/blogs/2025-03-10-log-benchmark-greptimedb).

### Is the Log-Structured Merge-Tree engine similar to Kafka's engine model?

From a technical storage perspective, they are similar. However, the actual data formats differ: GreptimeDB reads and writes Parquet format, while Kafka uses its own RecordBatch format. To analyze time-series data temporarily stored in Kafka, it needs to be written into GreptimeDB first.

You can use Vector to consume Kafka messages and write them into GreptimeDB. For more details, refer to [this article](https://greptime.com/blogs/2024-10-29-ingest-data-using-vector).

### Are there limitations on the number of tables or columns in GreptimeDB? Does having many columns affect read and write performance?

Generally, there are no strict limitations. With a few hundred tables, as long as there aren't many primary key columns, the impact on write performance is minimal (measured by the number of points written per second, not rows).

Similarly, for reads, if queries only involve a subset of columns, the memory and computational load will not be significantly high.

### How many servers are generally needed to set up a reliable GreptimeDB cluster, and how should Frontend, Datanode, and Metasrv be deployed? Should each node run all three services regardless of the number of nodes?

A minimum of 3 nodes is required, with each node running the 3 services: metasrv, frontend, and datanode. However, the exact number of nodes depends on the scale of data being handled.

It is not necessary to deploy all three services on each node. A small-sized cluster can be set up with 3 nodes dedicated to metasrv. Frontend and datanode can be deployed on equal nodes, with one container running two processes.

For more general advice for deployment, please read [Capacity Plan](/user-guide/administration/capacity-plan.md).

### In the latest version, does the Flow Engine (pre-computation) feature support PromQL syntax for calculations?

This is a good suggestion. Currently, the Flow Engine does not support PromQL syntax for calculations. We will evaluate this, as it seems theoretically feasible.

### Will Metasrv support storage backends like MySQL or PostgreSQL?

The latest version of GreptimeDB now supports PostgreSQL as the storage backend for Metasrv. For details, please refer to [here](/user-guide/deployments/configuration.md#metasrv-only-configuration).

### What is the best way to downsample interface traffic rates (maximum rate within every hour) from multiple NICs(network interface controller) across thousands of computers every 30 seconds, so that the data can be kept for many years?

Using a flow table is the appropriate tool for this task. A simple flow task should suffice. The output of a flow task is stored in a normal table, allowing it to be kept indefinitely.

### Can GreptimeDB create dynamic day partitions?

Yes. Within a Region, time-series data is dynamically organized by time by default, without requiring any configuration. Please note that this is a different concept from the sharding of distributed tables. One refers to data organization within a shard(called region), while the other refers to the distributed partitioning of the data.

### Which parts of DataFusion are customized in GreptimeDB?

GreptimeDB customizes the following aspects of DataFusion:
- PromQL query support.
- Distributed query execution.
- Custom UDFs (User-Defined Functions) and UDAFs (User-Defined Aggregate Functions).
- Custom optimization rules

### Does the open-source version of GreptimeDB support fine-grained access control?

The open-source version supports basic username-password authentication only. Fine-grained access control like RBAC is available in the enterprise edition.

### Does writing TIMESTAMP values in datetime format affect query performance?

No, writing in datetime format (e.g., yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss) does not affect query performance. The underlying storage format remains consistent.

### When assessing data compression, should I consider only the data directory size or include the wal directory?

You only need to consider the data directory size. The WAL directory is cyclically reused and does not factor into data compression metrics.

### In cluster mode, without using PARTITION during table creation, does data automatically balance across datanodes?

Currently, data does not automatically balance across datanodes without the PARTITION feature. This capability requires the implementation of region split and auto-rebalance, which is planned for versions v1.2 or v1.3.
