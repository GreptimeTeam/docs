# Upgrade
If your currently deployed GreptimeDB version is v0.12 or higher, v0.14 is fully compatible with existing database configurations and data formats, allowing for a direct upgrade. If you are using a version prior to v0.12, it is recommended to first refer to the v0.12 upgrade documentation to upgrade your database to v0.12, and then upgrade to v0.14, to ensure compatibility and a smooth transition.
