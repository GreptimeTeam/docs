**GreptimeDB** is an open-source, cloud-native, unified observability database for metrics, logs and traces. You can gain real-time insights from edge to cloudâ€”at any scale.

GreptimeDB is also on cloud as [GreptimeCloud](https://greptime.com/product/cloud),
a fully-managed observability database service that features serverless scalability,
seamless integration with rich ecosystems.

Our core developers have been building observability data platforms for years. Based on their best-practices, GreptimeDB is born to give you:

- **All-in-One Observability Database**: Process metrics, logs, and traces in real-time through a unified database with native [SQL](/user-guide/query-data/sql.md), [PromQL](/user-guide/query-data/promql.md), and [streaming processing](/user-guide/flow-computation/overview.md) support. It replaces complex legacy data stacks with a high-performance single solution.
- **High-Performance Engine**: Built with Rust for high performance and reliability. Rich [indexing options](/user-guide/manage-data/data-index.md) (inverted, full-text, skip list, and vector indexing) accelerate queries, enabling sub-second responses on petabyte-scale datasets and handling hundreds of thousands of concurrent requests.
- **Significant Cost Reduction**: Achieve 50x lower operational and storage costs through a compute-storage separation [architecture](/user-guide/concepts/architecture.md). Scale flexibly across cloud storage systems (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) with a fully-managed cloud service [GreptimeCloud](https://greptime.com/product/cloud), for simplified management.
- **Infinity Scalability**: Purpose-built for [Kubernetes](/user-guide/deployments/deploy-on-kubernetes/greptimedb-operator-management.md) and cloud environments with industry-leading compute-storage separation. Enables unlimited scaling across cloud environments while efficiently managing cardinality explosion at a massive scale.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Features standardized SQL and PromQL interfaces, a built-in web dashboard, REST API, and support for MySQL/PostgreSQL protocols. Widely compatible with popular data [ingestion protocols](/user-guide/protocols/overview.md) for seamless migration and integration.
- **Flexible Deployment Options**: Deploy anywhere, from ARM-based edge devices to cloud environments, with unified APIs and bandwidth-efficient data synchronization. Query edge and cloud data seamlessly using identical APIs.
