# MindsDB

[MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/) is an open-source machine learning platform that
enables developers to easily incorporate advanced machine learning capabilities
with existing databases.

Your GreptimeDB instance work out of box as using GreptimeDB extension with
MindsDB. You can configure GreptimeDB as a data source in MindsDB using MySQL protocol:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE greptime_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'greptimedb',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "<host>",
  "port": 4002,
  "database": "<dbname>",
  "user": "<username>",
  "password": "<password>",
  "ssl": True
};

```

- `<host>` is the hostname or IP address of your GreptimeDB instance.
- `<dbname>` is the name of the database you want to connect to.
- `<username>` and `<password>` are your [GreptimeDB credentials](/user-guide/deployments/authentication/static.md).

MindsDB is a great gateway for many machine learning features, including
time-series forecasting, for your time series data stored in our instance. See
[MindsDB docs](https://docs.mindsdb.com/what-is-mindsdb) for more information.
