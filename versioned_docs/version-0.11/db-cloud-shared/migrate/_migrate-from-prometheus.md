GreptimeDB can be used to store time series data for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
Additionally, GreptimeDB supports the Prometheus query language via its HTTP API.
This allows for an easy migration of your Prometheus long-term storage to GreptimeDB.

## Data model in difference

To understand the differences between the data models of Prometheus and GreptimeDB, please refer to the [Data Model](/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observerbility/prometheus.md#data-model) in the Ingest Data documentation.
