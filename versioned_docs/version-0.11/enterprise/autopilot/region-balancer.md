# Region Balancer

This plugin balances the write load of regions across datanodes, using specified window sizes and load thresholds to prevent frequent region migrations.

```toml
[[plugins]]
[plugins.region_balancer]

max_window = "45s"

window_stability_threshold = 2

min_load_threshold = "10MB"

tick_interval = "45s"
```

## Configuration Parameters

- `max_window`: string
  - **Description**: Defines the time span for the sliding window used to calculate the short-term average load of a region. This window helps smooth out temporary spikes in load, reducing the chance of unnecessary rebalancing.
  - **Units**: Time (e.g., `"45s"` represents 45 seconds).
  - **Recommendation**: Adjust according to load volatility. Larger values smooth more effectively but may delay load balancing responses.
- `window_stability_threshold`: integer
  - **Description**: Specifies the number of consecutive windows that must meet the load-balancing criteria before a region migration is triggered. This threshold helps prevent frequent balancing actions, ensuring region migration only occurs when imbalance is sustained.
  - **Recommendation**: Higher values delay rebalancing triggers and suit environments with volatile loads; a value of 2 means that at least two consecutive windows must meet the threshold before triggering.
- `min_load_threshold`: string
  - **Description**: Minimum write load threshold (in bytes per second) to trigger region migration. Nodes with load below this value will not trigger rebalancing.
  - **Units**: Bytes (e.g., `"10MB"` represents 10 MiB).
  - **Recommendation**: Set an appropriate minimum to avoid triggering region migration with low load. Adjust based on typical traffic.
- `tick_interval`: string
  - **Description**: Interval at which the balancer checks and potentially triggers a rebalancing task.
  - **Units**: Time (e.g., `"45s"` represents 45 seconds).
  - **Recommendation**: Set based on desired responsiveness and load volatility. Shorter intervals allow faster responses but may increase overhead.
