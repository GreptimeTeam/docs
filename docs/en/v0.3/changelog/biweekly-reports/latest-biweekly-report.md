## Highlights of Recent PR

### [Support starting GreptimeDB clusters with KubeBlocks](https://github.com/apecloud/kubeblocks/pull/4822)

We now support starting GreptimeDB clusters with KubeBlocks.

### [Enrich sqlness test scenarios](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2073)

We have enriched the sqlness test scenarios by adding test cases for the following three data types: `timestamp`, `float`, and `string`, with reference to DuckDB's test cases.

### [Support gRPC row format write protocol](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2188)

Until now, GreptimeDB has only provided support for the gRPC protocol in columnar format. Constructing data in columnar format is less client (SDK) friendly than in row format, which poses an additional burden on the development of cross-multilingual SDKs.

At the same time, the GreptimeDB-compatible InfluxDB Line Protocol and Prometheus Write Protocol both build data based on "rows". Based on these factors, we decided to support for the gRPC row format write protocol. We will provide a more user-friendly data format without compromising performance. Related PRs also include [#2189](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2189), [#2231](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2231) and [#2263](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2263).

### [Optimize `DESC TABLE` experience](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2256)

We optimized the `DESC TABLE` experience in [#2256](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2256) and [#2272](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2272):

- Add a `Key` column to describe the primary key information (both `Tag` and `Timestamp` are considered as primary key).

In the current output, the primary key information is stored in the Semantic Type column, which is inconsistent with the Semantic Type (Tag, Field, Timestamp) in the gRPC Protocol, so the optimization proposes a separate column `Key` to describe the primary key, and the Semantic Type column remains the same as in the gRPC Protocol.

Before:

```rust
+-----------+----------------------+------+---------+---------------+
| Field     | Type                 | Null | Default | Semantic Type |
+-----------+----------------------+------+---------+---------------+
| ts        | TimestampMillisecond | NO   |         | TIME INDEX    |
| collector | String               | YES  |         | PRIMARY KEY   |
| host      | String               | YES  |         | PRIMARY KEY   |
| val       | Float64              | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+-----------+----------------------+------+---------+---------------+
```

After:

```rust
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
| Field     | Type                 | Key | Null | Default | Semantic Type |
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
| ts        | TimestampMillisecond | PRI | NO   |         | TIMESTAMP     |
| collector | String               | PRI | YES  |         | TAG           |
| host      | String               | PRI | YES  |         | TAG           |
| val       | Float64              |     | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
```

- Field to Column

In the output of the `DESC TABLE`, we use the name Field (following the MySQL specification), but our time series data model also contains Field (Tag, Field, Timestamp), which can be confusing for users. So we change it to Column.

Before:

```rust
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
| Field     | Type                 | Key | Null | Default | Semantic Type |
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
| ts        | TimestampMillisecond | PRI | NO   |         | TIMESTAMP     |
| collector | String               | PRI | YES  |         | TAG           |
| host      | String               | PRI | YES  |         | TAG           |
| val       | Float64              |     | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
```

After:

```rust
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
| Column    | Type                 | Key | Null | Default | Semantic Type |
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
| ts        | TimestampMillisecond | PRI | NO   |         | TIMESTAMP     |
| collector | String               | PRI | YES  |         | TAG           |
| host      | String               | PRI | YES  |         | TAG           |
| val       | Float64              |     | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+-----------+----------------------+-----+------+---------+---------------+
```
