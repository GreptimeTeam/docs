## Highlights of Recent PR
[**#2331 Optimized SQL data types**](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2331)

Before this PR, the data types displayed in CREATE TABLE and DESC TABLE were different, which was confusing for users. For instance:

```sql
CREATE TABLE data_types (
  s string,
  tint tinyint,
  sint smallint,
  i int,
  bint bigint,
  v varchar,
  f float,
  d double,
  b boolean,
  vb varbinary,
  dt date,
  dtt datetime,
  ts0 timestamp(0),
  ts3 timestamp(3),
  ts6 timestamp(6),
  ts9 timestamp(9) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP TIME INDEX,
  PRIMARY KEY(s));
```

```bash
+--------+----------------------+------+------+---------------------+---------------+
| Column | Type                 | Key  | Null | Default             | Semantic Type |
+--------+----------------------+------+------+---------------------+---------------+
| s      | String               | PRI  | YES  |                     | TAG           |
| tint   | Int8                 |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| sint   | Int16                |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| i      | Int32                |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| bint   | Int64                |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| v      | String               |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| f      | Float32              |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| d      | Float64              |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| b      | Boolean              |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| vb     | Binary               |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| dt     | Date                 |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| dtt    | DateTime             |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| ts0    | TimestampSecond      |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| ts3    | TimestampMillisecond |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| ts6    | TimestampMicrosecond |      | YES  |                     | FIELD         |
| ts9    | TimestampNanosecond  | PRI  | NO   | current_timestamp() | TIMESTAMP     |
+--------+----------------------+------+------+---------------------+---------------+
16 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This PR adds aliases for SQL data types, as shown below:
- TimestampSecond, Timestamp_s, Timestamp_sec for Timestamp(0).
- TimestampMillisecond, Timestamp_ms for Timestamp(3).
- TimestampMicrosecond, Timestamp_us for Timestamp(6).
- TimestampNanosecond, Timestamp_ns for Timestamp(9).
- INT8 for tinyint
- INT16 for smallint
- INT32 for int
- INT64 for bigint
- And UINT8, UINT16 etc. for UnsignedTinyint etc.

Now, you can also use GreptimeDB types to create tables in SQL:

```sql
 CREATE TABLE data_types (
  s String,
  tint Int8,
  sint Int16,
  i Int32,
  bint Int64,
  v String,
  f Float32,
  d Float64,
  b Boolean,
  vb Varbinary,
  dt Date,
  dtt DateTime,
  ts0 TimestampSecond,
  ts3 TimestampMillisecond,
  ts6 TimestampMicrosecond,
  ts9 TimestampNanosecond DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP TIME INDEX,
  PRIMARY KEY(s));
```

[**#2310 Added support for adding primary key columns through ALTER TABLE**](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2310)

In time-series data model, Label or Tag corresponds to the primary key in the Table model in GreptimeDB. Therefore, it's necessary to support adding primary key columns through the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

[**#96 Refined the heartbeat protocol within the distributed architecture**](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptime-proto/pull/96)

In the upcoming 0.4 release, we went through an in-depth restructuring and upgrade of the database architecture. The first to undergo remodelling was the heartbeat protocol that serves as the foundation of distributed coordination communication. The intent behind this overhaul was to manage larger clusters and a higher number of regions more efficiently. To that end, we trimmed the size of the heartbeat package to alleviate the communication layer's load. For instance, we removed the unnecessary NodeStat, eliminated information such as CPU and Load, and only retained W/RCU as the sole reference for load balancing and scheduling. At the same time, we also removed unnecessary information like table names and database names.

[**#2281 Restricted the TIME INDEX type**](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/2281)

The TIME INDEX type is restricted, only allowing timestamp types to serve as TIME INDEX to prevent potential ambiguities.
