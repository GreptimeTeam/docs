# Table Sharding

The sharding of stored data is essential to any distributed database. This document will describe how table's data in GreptimeDB is being sharded, and distributed.

## Partition

In GreptimeDB, logically, data is sharded in partitions. Because GreptimeDB is using "table" to
group data and SQL to query them, we borrow the word "partition", which is a concept commonly used
in OLTP databases.

In GreptimeDB, a table can be horizontally partitioned in multiple ways and it uses the same
partitioning types (and corresponding syntax) as in MySQL. Currently, GreptimeDB supports "RANGE COLUMNS partitioning".

In "RANGE COLUMNS partitioning", each partition includes only a portion of the data from the table, and is
grouped by some column(s) value range. For example, we can partition a table in GreptimeDB like
this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  a INT PRIMARY KEY,
  b STRING,
  ts TIMESTAMP TIME INDEX,
)
PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS (a) (
  PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
  PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20),
  PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE),
);
```

`my_table` that we created above has 3 partitions. Partition "p0" contains a portion of data that
only has rows of column "a < 10"; partition "p1" contains rows of "10 <= a < 20"; partition "p2"
includes the remaining rows of "a >= 20".

::: warning Important

1. Value ranges must be strictly increased, and finally ends with "`MAXVALUE`".
2. The partition column must be a primary key.

:::

::: tip Note
Currently expressions are not supported in "PARTITION BY RANGE" syntax, you can only supply column names.

## Region

The data within a table is logically split after creating partitions. You may ask the question "
how are the data, after being logically partitioned, stored in the GreptimeDB? The answer is in "`Region`"s.

Each region is corresponding to a partition, and stores the data in the partition. The regions are distributed among
`Datanode`s. Our
`metasrv` will move regions among Datanodes automatically, according to the states of Datanodes.
Also, `metasrv` can split or merge regions according to their data volume or access pattern.

The relationship between partition and region can be viewed as the following diagram:
