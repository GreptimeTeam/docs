# Overview

## GreptimeDB Operator

The [GreptimeDB Operator](https://github.com/GrepTimeTeam/greptimedb-operator) manages the GreptimeDB resources on Kubernetes using the Operator pattern. 
It is like an autopilot that automates the deployment, provisioning, and orchestration of the GreptimeDB cluster and standalone.
With the help of the GreptimeDB Operator, you can quickly deploy, manage, and scale GreptimeDB clusters on Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud.

We highly recommend using the GreptimeDB Operator to deploy GreptimeDB on Kubernetes.
