# Overview

## GreptimeDB on Kubernetes

GreptimeDB is a time-series database built for cloud-native environments and can be deployed on Kubernetes since day one. We provide a [GreptimeDB Operator](https://github.com/GrepTimeTeam/greptimedb-operator) to manage GreptimeDB on Kubernetes, automating the setup, provisioning, and management of GreptimeDB cluster and standalone instances. This makes it easy to quickly deploy and scale GreptimeDB in any Kubernetes environment, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

We **highly recommend** using the GreptimeDB Operator to deploy GreptimeDB on Kubernetes.
