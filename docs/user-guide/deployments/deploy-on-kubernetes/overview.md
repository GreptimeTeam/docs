# Overview

## GreptimeDB Operator

The [GreptimeDB Operator](https://github.com/GrepTimeTeam/greptimedb-operator) uses the [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) to manage GreptimeDB on Kubernetes, automating the setup, provisioning, and management of GreptimeDB cluster and standalone instances. 
 This makes it easy to quickly deploy and scale GreptimeDB in any Kubernetes environment, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

We **highly recommend** using the GreptimeDB Operator to deploy GreptimeDB on Kubernetes.

## Manage GreptimeDB with the GreptimeDB Operator

You can take [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) as your first guide to understand the whole picture. This guide provides the complete process of deploying the GreptimeDB cluster on Kubernetes.
