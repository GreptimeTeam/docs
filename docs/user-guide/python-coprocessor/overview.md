# Python Coprocessor

Python prevails in the data science and AI world. To avoid spending lots of time and effort transferring and transforming data, we provide the capability of executing Python scripts in the database. We call it the python coprocessor: co-processing for time series data analysis and processing.
We think the python coprocessor in GreptimeDB is a perfect replacement for stored procedures in traditional RDMS, and also the user can create SQL UDF(User Defined Function) by defining coprocessors.
