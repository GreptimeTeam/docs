## Query languages

- [PromQL](./promql.md)
- [SQL](./sql.md)

Since v0.9, GreptimeDB supports view and CTE just like other databases, used to simplify queries:

* [View](./view.md)
* [Common Table Expression (CTE)](./cte.md)

<!-- ## Client SDK libraries

Client libraries provide a convenient way to connect to GreptimeDB and interact with data.
There are mature SQL driver libraries available for querying GreptimeDB.
For more information, please refer to the [Client Libraries](/user-guide/ingest-data/for-iot/grpc-sdks/overview.md) documentation. -->
