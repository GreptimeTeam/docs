# Overview

## Query languages

- [PromQL](./promql.md)
- [SQL](./sql.md)

Since v0.9, GreptimeDB supports view and CTE just like other databases, used to simplify queries:

* [View](./view.md)
* [Common Table Expression (CTE)](./cte.md)

## Recommended libraries

Since GreptimeDB uses SQL as its main query language, you can use mature SQL drivers that support MySQL or PostgreSQL to query data.
For more information, please refer to the [SQL Tools](/reference/sql-tools.md) documentation.

## Query external data

GreptimeDB has the capability to query external data files. For more information, please refer to the [Query External Data](./query-external-data.md) documentation.
