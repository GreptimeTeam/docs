# Prometheus

## Data Model

Data in GreptimeDB is organized as tables, which can be thought of as groups of columns. There are three types of columns: Time Index, Primiary Key, and non of both. When mapping to Prometheus, Time Index is the timestamp, Primary Key is the tag (or label) and the rest are values. Hence, GreptimeDB can be thought of as a multi-value data model, one table is a group of multiple Prometheus metrics. For example:

## Storage

GreptimeDB can be used as long-term storage for Prometheus. Using GreptimeDB as a Prometheus backend is a seamless experience. Since Prometheus has built-in support for setting up basic authentication information during the configuration of remote write and read, all you need to do is add your configured username and password to the config YAML file and you're good to go!

First of all, create a database through your favourite SQL client:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE prometheus;
```

Then please follow the settings in [Prometheus configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file) (`prometheus.yml`):

```yaml
remote_write:
- url: http://localhost:4000/v1/prometheus/write?db=prometheus
- basic_auth:
    username: greptime_user
    password: greptime_pwd

remote_read:
- url: http://localhost:4000/v1/prometheus/read?db=prometheus
- basic_auth:
    username: greptime_user
    password: greptime_pwd
```

Note: Be sure to replace `greptime_user(username)`, `greptime_pwd(password)` with your own username and password. Please refer to client [authentication](./clients.md#authentication).

The `db` parameter in url represents the database that we want to write, it's `public` if not present.

Show tables in Prometheus when writing successfully:
```sql
use prometheus;
show tables;
```

```sql
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Tables                                                        |

### Prometheus Metrics in GreptimeDB

When the metrics are written into GreptimeDB by remote write endpoint, they will be transformed as
follows:

| Sample Metrics | In GreptimeDB                | GreptimeDB Data Types |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------|
| Name           | Table (Auto-created) Name    | String                |
| Value          | Column (greptime_value)     | Double                |
| Timestamp      | Column (greptime_timestamp) | Timestamp             |
| Label          | Column                       | String                |

 A primary key with all label columns will be created automatically. When a new label is added, it
 will be added into primary key automatically too.

### Example: Prometheus metrics in GreptimeDB Table

```text
prometheus_remote_storage_samples_total{instance="localhost:9090", job="prometheus",
remote_name="648f0c", url="http://localhost:4000/v1/prometheus/write"} 500
```

This example will be transformed as a row in the table `prometheus_remote_storage_samples_total`ï¼š

| Column             | Value                                       | Column  Data  Type |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| instance           | localhost:9090                              | String             |
| job                | prometheus                                  | String             |
| remote_name        | 648f0c                                      | String             |
| url                | `http://localhost:4000/v1/prometheus/write` | String             |
| greptime_value     | 500                                         | Double             |
| greptime_timestamp | The sample's unix timestamp                 | Timestamp          |

## Prometheus Query Language

GreptimeDB can be used as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus in Grafana, because GreptimeDB supports PromQL (Prometheus Query Language). GreptimeDB has reimplemented PromQL natively in Rust and exposes the ability to several interfaces, including the HTTP API of Prometheus, the HTTP API of GreptimeDB, and the SQL interface.

### Prometheus' HTTP API

<!-- Maybe add a section to introduce the simulated interfaces, when there is more than one supported -->

Prometheus server has a bunch of HTTP APIs (see their [official document](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api)), and GreptimeDB has implemented the [`range_query`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries) interface, which allows you to query the data in a given time range with PromQL.

We keep the setting of the path and parameter the same as that in Prometheus, so you can use the same client to query GreptimeDB.

### GreptimeDB's HTTP API

GreptimeDB also exposes an HTTP API for querying with PromQL. You can find it on `/promql` path under the current stable API version `/v1`, in **GreptimeDB HTTP API Port**. For example:

```shell
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic {{authorization if exists}}' \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'db=public' \
  --data-urlencode 'query=avg(system_metrics{idc="idc_a"})' \
  --data-urlencode 'start=1667446797' \
  --data-urlencode 'end=1667446799' \
  --data-urlencode 'step=1s' \
  http://localhost:4000/v1/promql
```

The input parameters are similar to the [`range_query`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries) in Prometheus' HTTP API:

- `db=<database name>`: Required when using GreptimeDB with authorization, otherwise can be omitted if you are using the default `public` database.
- `query=<string>`: Required. Prometheus expression query string.
- `start=<rfc3339 | unix_timestamp>`: Required. The start timestamp, which is inclusive. It is used to set the range of time in `TIME INDEX` column.
- `end=<rfc3339 | unix_timestamp>`: Required. The end timestamp, which is inclusive. It is used to set the range of time in `TIME INDEX` column.
- `step=<duration | float>`: Required. Query resolution step width in duration format or float number of seconds.

Here are some examples for each type of parameter:
- rfc3339
  - `2015-07-01T20:11:00Z` (default to seconds resolution)
  - `2015-07-01T20:11:00.781Z` (with milliseconds resolution)
  - `2015-07-02T04:11:00+08:00` (with timezone offset)
- unix timestamp
  - `1435781460` (default to seconds resolution)
  - `1435781460.781` (with milliseconds resolution)
- duration
  - `1h` (1 hour)
  - `5d1m` (5 days and 1 minute)
  - `2` (2 seconds)
  - `2s` (also 2 seconds)

The result format is the same as `/sql` interface described in [query data](./query-data.md#http-api).

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "output": [
    {
      "records": {
        "schema": {
          "column_schemas": [
            {
              "name": "ts",
              "data_type": "TimestampMillisecond"
            },
            {
              "name": "AVG(system_metrics.cpu_util)",
              "data_type": "Float64"
            },
            {
              "name": "AVG(system_metrics.memory_util)",
              "data_type": "Float64"
            },
            {
              "name": "AVG(system_metrics.disk_util)",
              "data_type": "Float64"
            }
          ]
        },
        "rows": [
          [
            1667446798000,
            80.1,
            70.3,
            90
          ],
          [
            1667446799000,
            80.1,
            70.3,
            90
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "execution_time_ms": 5
}
```
<!-- TODO New paths that compatible with Promethues APIs -->

### SQL

GreptimeDB also extends SQL grammar to support PromQL. You can start with the `TQL` (Time-series Query Language) keyword to write parameters and queries. The grammar looks like this:

```sql
TQL [EVAL|EVALUATE] (<START>, <END>, <STEP>) <QUERY>
```

`<START>` specifies the query start range and `<END>` specifies the end time. `<STEP>` identifies the query resolution step width. All of them can either be an unquoted number (represent UNIX timestamp for `<START>` and `<END>`, and duration in seconds for `<STEP>`), or a quoted string (represent an RFC3339 timestamp for `<START>` and `<END>`, and duration in string format for `<STEP>`).

For example:

```sql
TQL EVAL (1676738180, 1676738780, '10s') sum(some_metric)
```

You can write the above command in all places that support SQL, including the GreptimeDB HTTP API, SDK, PostgreSQL and MySQL client etc.

### Limitations

Though GreptimeDB supports a rich set of data types, the PromQL implementation is still limited to the following types:
- timestamp: `Timestamp`
- tag: `String`
- value: `Double`

Currently only a subset of PromQL is supported. Here attaches the compatibility list. You can also check our latest compliance report in this [tracking issue](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/1042).

#### Literal

Both string and float literals are supported, with the same [rule](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#literals) as PromQL.

#### Selector

Both instant and range selector are supported. The only exception is the label matching on metric name, e.g.: `{__name__!="request_count}"` (but the equal-matching case is supported: `{__name__="request_count}"`).

Time duration and offset are supported, but `@` modifier is not supported yet.
