# OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a vendor-neutral open-source observability framework for instrumenting, generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics, logs. The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) defines the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate processes such as collectors and telemetry backends.

## OpenTelemetry Collectors

You can easily configure GreptimeDB as the target for your OpenTelemetry collector.
For more information, please refer to the [Grafana Alloy](alloy.md) example.

## Metrics

GreptimeDB is an observability backend to consume OpenTelemetry Metrics natively via [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp) protocol.

### OTLP/HTTP API

To send OpenTelemetry Metrics to GreptimeDB through OpenTelemetry SDK libraries, use the following information:

* URL: `http{s}://<host>/v1/otlp/v1/metrics`
* Headers:
  * `X-Greptime-DB-Name`: `<dbname>`
  * `Authorization`: `Basic` authentication, which is a Base64 encoded string of `<username>:<password>`. For more information, please refer to [Authentication](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/deployments/authentication/static/) and [HTTP API](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/protocols/http#authentication)

The request uses binary protobuf to encode the payload, so you need to use packages that support `HTTP/protobuf`. For example, in Node.js, you can use [`exporter-trace-otlp-proto`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto); in Go, you can use [`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp); in Java, you can use [`io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-exporter-otlp); and in Python, you can use [`opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http/).

:::tip NOTE
The package names may change according to OpenTelemetry, so we recommend that you refer to the official OpenTelemetry documentation for the most up-to-date information.

### Data Model

The OTLP metrics data model is mapped to the GreptimeDB data model according to the following rules:

- The name of the Metric will be used as the name of the GreptimeDB table, and the table will be automatically created if it does not exist.
- All attributes, including resource attributes, scope attributes, and data point attributes, will be used as tag columns of the GreptimeDB table.
- The timestamp of the data point will be used as the timestamp index of GreptimeDB, and the column name is `greptime_timestamp`.
- The data of Gauge/Sum data types will be used as the field column of GreptimeDB, and the column name is `greptime_value`.
- Each quantile of the Summary data type will be used as a separated data column of GreptimeDB, and the column name is `greptime_pxx`, where xx is the quantile, such as 90/99, etc.
- Histogram and ExponentialHistogram are not supported yet, we may introduce the Histogram data type to natively support these two types in a later version.

## Logs

GreptimeDB consumes OpenTelemetry Logs natively via [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp) protocol.

### OTLP/HTTP API API

To send OpenTelemetry Logs to GreptimeDB through OpenTelemetry SDK libraries, use the following information:

* URL: `http{s}://<host>/v1/otlp/v1/logs`
* Headers:
  * `X-Greptime-DB-Name`: `<dbname>`
  * `Authorization`: `Basic` authentication, which is a Base64 encoded string of `<username>:<password>`. For more information, please refer to [Authentication](/user-guide/deployments/authentication/static.md) and [HTTP API](/user-guide/protocols/http.md#authentication).
  * `X-Greptime-Log-Table-Name`: `<table_name>` (optional) - The table name to store the logs. If not provided, the default table name is `opentelemetry_logs`.
  * `X-Greptime-Log-Extract-Keys`: `<extract_keys>` (optional) - The keys to extract from the attributes. The keys should be separated by commas (`,`). For example, `key1,key2,key3` will extract the keys `key1`, `key2`, and `key3` from the attributes and promote them to the top level of the log, setting them as tags. If the field type is array, float, or object, an error will be returned. If a pipeline is provided, this setting will be ignored.
  * `X-Greptime-Log-Pipeline-Name`: `<pipeline_name>` (optional) - The pipeline name to process the logs. If not provided, the extract keys will be used to process the logs.
  * `X-Greptime-Log-Pipeline-Version`: `<pipeline_version>` (optional) - The pipeline version to process the logs. If not provided, the latest version of the pipeline will be used.

The request uses binary protobuf to encode the payload, so you need to use packages that support `HTTP/protobuf`.

:::tip NOTE
The package names may change according to OpenTelemetry, so we recommend that you refer to the official OpenTelemetry documentation for the most up-to-date information.

### Example Code

Please refer to the [Alloy documentation](alloy.md#logs) for example code on how to send OpenTelemetry logs to GreptimeDB.

### Data Model

The OTLP logs data model is mapped to the GreptimeDB data model according to the following rules:

Default table schema:

```sql
+-----------------------+---------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
| Column                | Type                | Key  | Null | Default | Semantic Type |
+-----------------------+---------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
| timestamp             | TimestampNanosecond | PRI  | NO   |         | TIMESTAMP     |
| trace_id              | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| span_id               | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| severity_text         | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| severity_number       | Int32               |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| body                  | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| log_attributes        | Json                |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| trace_flags           | UInt32              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| scope_name            | String              | PRI  | YES  |         | TAG           |
| scope_version         | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| scope_attributes      | Json                |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| scope_schema_url      | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| resource_attributes   | Json                |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| resource_schema_url   | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+-----------------------+---------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
17 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- You can use `X-Greptime-Log-Table-Name` to specify the table name for storing the logs. If not provided, the default table name is `opentelemetry_logs`.
- All attributes, including resource attributes, scope attributes, and log attributes, will be stored as a JSON column in the GreptimeDB table.
- The timestamp of the log will be used as the timestamp index in GreptimeDB, with the column name `timestamp`. It is preferred to use `time_unix_nano` as the timestamp column. If `time_unix_nano` is not provided, `observed_time_unix_nano` will be used instead.

## Traces

GreptimeDB supports writing OpenTelemetry traces data directly via the [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp) protocol, and it also provides a table model of OpenTelemetry traces for users to query and analyze traces data conveniently.

### OTLP/HTTP API

You can use [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) or other similar technologies to add traces data to your application. You can also use [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to collect traces data and use GreptimeDB as the backend storage.

To send OpenTelemetry traces data to GreptimeDB through OpenTelemetry SDK libraries, please use the following information:

* URL: `http{s}://<host>/v1/otlp/v1/traces`
* Headers: The headers section is the same as the [Logs](#Logs) section, you can refer to the [Logs](#Logs) section for more information. 

By default, GreptimeDB will write traces data to the `opentelemetry_traces` table in the `public` database. If you want to write traces data to a different table, you can use the `X-Greptime-DB-Name` and `X-Greptime-Log-Table-Name` headers to specify the database and table name.

GreptimeDB will accept **protobuf encoded traces data** via **HTTP protocol** and the following headers are required:

- `content-type` should be configured as `application/x-protobuf`;
- `x-greptime-pipeline-name` should be configured as `greptime_trace_v1`;

### Example Code

You can directly send OpenTelemetry traces data to GreptimeDB, or use OpenTelemetry Collector to collect traces data and use GreptimeDB as the backend storage. Please refer to the example code in the [OpenTelemetry Traces documentation](/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/opentelemetry-traces.md) to learn how to send OpenTelemetry traces data to GreptimeDB.

### Data Model

GreptimeDB will map the OTLP traces data model to the following table schema:

```sql
+------------------------------------+---------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
| Column                             | Type                | Key  | Null | Default | Semantic Type |

| span_id                            | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| span_kind                          | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |

| span_status_code                   | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| span_status_message                | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| trace_state                        | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| scope_name                         | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| scope_version                      | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| service_name                       | String              | PRI  | YES  |         | TAG           |
| span_attributes.net.sock.peer.addr | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| span_attributes.peer.service       | String              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| span_events                        | Json                |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| span_links                         | Json                |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+------------------------------------+---------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
```

- Each row represents a single span
- The core OpenTelemetry fields such as `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `service_name` are promoted as dedicated table columns
- Resource attributes and span attributes are automatically flattened into separate columns, with column names being their JSON keys (using `.` to connect multiple levels of nesting)
- `span_events` and `span_links` are stored as JSON data types by default

By default, the table is partitioned into 16 uniform regions based on the `trace_id` to efficiently store and query all trace data.
