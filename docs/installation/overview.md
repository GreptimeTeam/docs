# Installation

To get GreptimeDB on your local machine, you can either:

- [Download our pre-built binary](./download-pre-built.md)
- [Build from source](../developer-guide/get-started.md)

To install GreptimeDB in distributed mode, we recommend a Kubernetes
environment. [Check our guide](./kubernetes/overview.md) to setup GreptimeDB
cluster on Kubernetes.
