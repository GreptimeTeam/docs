# Installation

To get GreptimeDB on your local machine, you can either:

- [Build from source](./build-from-source.md)
- [Download our pre-built binary](./download-pre-built.md)

For full installation of GreptimeDB's distributed mode, we recommand a
Kubernetes environment. [Check our guide](./kubernetes/overview.md) to setup
GreptimeDB cluster on Kubernetes.
