# Upgrade

From `v0.4`, we provide a built-in utility to help upgrade your previous GreptimeDB deployment to the latest version if there are some breaking changes.
It's recommended to use this method to upgrade your GreptimeDB with different versions.

The lowest version that can be upgraded by this tool is `v0.3.0`.
