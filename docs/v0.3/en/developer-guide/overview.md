# Overview

## Architecture

`GreptimeDB` consists of the following key components:

- `Frontend` that exposes read and write service in various protocols, forwards requests to
  `Datanode`.
- `Datanode` is responsible for storing data to persistent storage such as local disk or object storage in the cloud such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage etc.
- `Metasrv` that coordinates the operations between the `Frontend` and `Datanode`.

## Concepts

To better understand `GreptimeDB`, a few concepts need to be introduced:

- A `table` is where user data is stored in `GreptimeDB`. A `table` has a schema and a totally
  ordered primary key. A `table` is split into segments called `region` by its primary key.
- A `region` is a contiguous segment of a table, and also could be regarded as a partition in some
  relational databases. A `region` could be replicated on multiple `datanode` and only one of these
  replicas is writable and can serve write requests, while any replica can serve read requests.
- A `datanode` stores and serves `region` to `frontends`. One `datanode` can serve multiple `regions`
  and one `region` can be served by multiple `datanodes`.
- The `metasrv` stores the metadata of the cluster, such as tables, `datanodes`, `regions` of each
  table, etc. It also coordinates `frontends` and `datanodes`.
- Each `datanode` or `frontend` has a remote catalog implementation, which fetches the metadata from
  `metasrv`, tells which `region` of a `table` is served by which `datanode`.
- A `frontend` is a stateless service that serves requests from client. It acts as a proxy to
  forward read and write requests to corresponding `datanode`, according to the mapping from catalog.
- A timeseries of a `table` is identified by its primary key. Each `table` must have a timestamp
  column, as `GreptimeDB` is a timeseries database. Data in `table` will be sorted by its primary key
  and
  timestamp, but the actual order is implementation specific and may change in the future.
- `table engines` are `GreptimeDB` components that handle the SQL operations for different `table`
  types.
  `Mito` is the default `table engine`. It uses a LSM-Tree based `storage engine` as its storage
  backend.

## How it works

![Interactions between components](/how-it-works.png)

Before diving into each component, let's take a high level view of how the database works.

- Users can interact with the database via various protocols, such as ingesting data using
  `InfluxDB line protocol`, then exploring the data using SQL or PromQL. The `frontend` is the
  component users or clients connect to and operate, thus hide `datanode` and `metasrv` behind it.
- Assumes a user uses the HTTP API to insert data into the database, by sending a HTTP request to a
  `frontend` instance. When the `frontend` receives the request, it then parses the request body using
  corresponding protocol parser, and finds the table to write to from a catalog manager based on
  `metasrv`.
- The `frontend` periodically fetches and caches the metadata from `metasrv`, thus it knows which
  `datanode`, or more precisely, the `region` a request should be sent to. A request may be split and
  sent to multiple `regions`, if its contents need to be stored in different `regions`.
- When `datanode` receives the request, it writes the data to the table, and then sends response
  back to the `frontend`. Writing to the table will then write to the underlying storage engine,
  which will eventually put the data to persistent device.
- Once `frontend` has received all responses from the target `datanode`s, it then sends the result
  back to the user.
