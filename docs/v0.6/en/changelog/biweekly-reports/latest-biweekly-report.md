# Biweekly Report - Lazy Load of Vector Builder Leads to a 90% Drop in Memory Usage
January 24, 2024
## Summary
Together with our global community of contributors, GreptimeDB continues to evolve and flourish as a growing open-source project. We are grateful to each and every one of you.

In the past two weeks, we have made steady progress. Below are some highlights:

- Continuous Performance Enhancements:
  - Memory usage reduced by up to 90% in scenarios with high null values.
  - Optimize the filter for reading Parquet files, gaining up to 50% faster TSBS test time.
- Expanding fuzz testing in GreptimeDB to encompass a wider array of scenarios.
- Officially launching Inverted Index, set to boost future read performance of GreptimeDB.
- Further developed support for SQL and PromQL features.
