## Highlights of Recent PR

### [#3278](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3278) Added partitions and `greptime_region_peers` tables to the information schema

- Users can query the distribution of Table Partitions through the `partitions` table.

- Users can query the distribution of regions through the `greptime_region_peers` table.

### [#3271](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3271) [#3293](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3293) Optimized the allocation logic for TableID during table creation

The new version allows procedures to handle the allocation of TableIDs during table creation, instead of pre-allocating TableIDs before table creation. This effectively reduces the waste of TableIDs in scenarios of concurrent table creations due to pre-allocation.

### [#3310](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3310) Optimized the display of distributed tracing links

Corrected the incorrect propagation of tracing ID in query chains and fixed the call chains under distributed tracing.

### [#3325](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3325) Added `migrate_region` and `procedure_state` functions

Users can migrate regions between Datanodes using the `migrate_region` function in SQL, and query the status of a specific procedure with the `procedure_state` function.

### [#3364](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3364) Optimized Column Filling Logic

The logic for filling NULL values in Put and Delete requests has been optimized for the Mito2 Engine, resulting in up to a threefold performance improvement in Put requests under specific conditions.

### [#3360](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/3360) GreptimeDB now supports the use of the `isnull function` in queries

## Good First Issue

### [#3366](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/3366) Refactored the implementation of information_schema to reduce redundant code within information_schema

Keywords: information_schema

Difficulty: Medium

### [#3365](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/3365) Simplified the writing of administration functions using Rust's procedural macros

Keywords: administration functions

Difficulty: Medium

### [#3354](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/3354) Added support for SHOW statements within the MySQL protocol for information_schema

Keywords: information_schema

Difficulty: Medium
