GreptimeDB can be configured as a [Grafana data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/add-a-data-source/).

## Prometheus

Click the Add data source button and select Prometheus as the type.

Fill in Prometheus server URL in HTTP:

`https://<host>/v1/prometheus`

Click basic auth in the Auth section and fill in your GreptimeDB username and password in Basic Auth Details:

- User: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

Click Custom HTTP Headers and add one header:

- Header: `x-greptime-db-name`
- Value: `<dbname>`

Then click Save & Test button to test the connection.

## MySQL

Click the Add data source button and select MySQL as the type. Fill in the following information in MySQL Connection:

- Host: `<host>:4002`
- Database: `<dbname>`
- User: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`
- Session timezone: `UTC`

Then click Save & Test button to test the connection.

Note that you need to use raw SQL editor for panel creation. SQL Builder is not
supported due to timestamp data type difference between GreptimeDB and vanilla
MySQL.
