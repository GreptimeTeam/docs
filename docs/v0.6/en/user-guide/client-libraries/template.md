GreptimeDB uses different client libraries for writing and querying data.
You can choose the client library that best suits your needs.

## Write data

GreptimeDB provides an ingester library to help you write data.
It utilizes the gRPC protocol,
which supports schemaless writing and eliminates the need to create tables before writing data.
For more information, refer to [Automatic Schema Generation](/user-guide/write-data/overview.md#automatic-schema-generation).

### Installation

### Connect to database

Username and password are always required to connect to GreptimeDB.
For how to set authentication to GreptimeDB, see [Authentication](/user-guide/clients/authentication.md).
Here we set the username and password when using the library to connect to GreptimeDB.

### Data model

Each row item in a table consists of three types of columns: `Tag`, `Timestamp`, and `Field`. For more information, see [Data Model](/user-guide/concepts/data-model.md).
The types of column values could be `String`, `Float`, `Int`, `Timestamp`, etc. For more information, see [Data Types](/reference/sql/data-types.md).

### Low-level API

The GreptimeDB low-level API provides a straightforward method to write data to GreptimeDB 
by adding rows to the table object with a predefined schema.

#### Create row objects

This following code snippet begins by constructing a table named `cpu_metric`,
which includes columns `host`, `cpu_user`, `cpu_sys`, and `ts`. 
Subsequently, it inserts a single row into the table.

The table consists of three types of columns:

- `Tag`: The `host` column, with values of type `String`.
- `Field`: The `cpu_user` and `cpu_sys` columns, with values of type `Float`.
- `Timestamp`: The `ts` column, with values of type `Timestamp`.

To improve the efficiency of writing data, you can create multiple rows at once to write to GreptimeDB.

#### Insert data

The following example shows how to insert rows to tables in GreptimeDB.

{template insert-rows%%}

#### Streaming insert

Streaming insert is useful when you want to insert a large amount of data such as importing historical data.

{template update-rows%%}

### High-level API

The high-level API uses an ORM style object to write data to GreptimeDB.
It allows you to create, insert, and update data in a more object-oriented way,
providing developers with a friendlier experience.
However, it is not as efficient as the low-level API.
This is because the ORM style object may consume more resources and time when converting the objects.

## Query data

GreptimeDB uses SQL as the main query language and is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Therefore, we recommend using mature SQL drivers to query data.
