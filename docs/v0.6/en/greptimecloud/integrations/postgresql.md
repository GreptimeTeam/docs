# PostgreSQL

GreptimeCloud exposes GreptimeDB access in PostgreSQL v3 wire protocol. Most
standard clients and drivers are compatible at wire protocol level, and the connection is encrypted with TLS.
Note that we don't use Postgres' SQL dialect in GreptimeDB, so there can be some statements
that are unsupported.
For more information, please refer to [Postgresql documentation](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/clients/postgresql) of GreptimeDB.

To connect to GreptimeCloud in Postgres wire protocol, using information below:

- Host: `<host>`
- Port: `4003`
- Database: `<dbname>`
- Username: `<username>`
- Password: `<password>`

## `psql`

The default cli tool bundled with PostgreSQL.

```text
psql -h <host> -p 4003 -U <username> -d <dbname> -W
```

## Postgres Connection String

Using the connection string below for compatible client libraries like psycopg,
rust-postgres and more.

```text
host=<host> port=4003 dbname=<dbname> user=<username> password=<password>
```

## URL
