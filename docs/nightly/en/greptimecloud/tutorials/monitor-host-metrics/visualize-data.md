Visualizing data in panels and monitoring metrics is important in a developer's daily work. From the GreptimeCloud console, click on `Open Prometheus Workbench`, then click on `+ New Ruleset` and `Add Group`. Name the group `host-monitor` and add panels.

To add panels for all the tables you're concerned with, select a table and click on `Add Panel` one by one. Once you've added all the necessary panels, click on the `Save` button to save them. You can then view the panels in your daily work to monitor the metrics. Additionally, you can set up alert rules for the panels to be notified when the metrics exceed the threshold.
