# Overview

In observability scenarios,
the ability to monitor and analyze system performance in real-time is crucial.
GreptimeDB integrates seamlessly with leading observability tools to provide a comprehensive view of your system's health and performance metrics. 

- [Prometheus Remote Write](./for-observerbility/prometheus.md): Integrate GreptimeDB as remote storage for Prometheus, suitable for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- [Vector](./for-observerbility/vector.md): Use GreptimeDB as a sink for Vector, ideal for complex data pipelines and diverse data sources.
- [OpenTelemetry](./for-observerbility/opentelemetry.md): Collect and export telemetry data to GreptimeDB for detailed observability insights.
- [InfluxDB Line Protocol](./for-iot/influxdb-line-protocol.md): A widely-used protocol for time-series data, facilitating migration from InfluxDB to GreptimeDB. The Telegraf integration method is also introduced in this document.
