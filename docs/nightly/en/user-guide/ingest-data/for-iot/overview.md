# Overview

The data ingestion is a critical part of the IoT data pipeline.
It is the process of collecting data from various sources, such as sensors, devices, and applications, and storing it in a central location for further processing and analysis.
The data ingestion is essential for ensuring that the data is accurate, reliable, and secure.

GreptimeDB can handle large volumes of data, process it in real-time, and store it efficiently for future analysis.
It also supports various data formats, protocols, and interfaces,
making it easy to integrate with different IoT devices and systems.
