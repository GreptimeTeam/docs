# Overview

`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` provides access to system metadata, such as the name of a database or table, the data type of a column, etc. GreptimeDB also provides some custom `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables to query metadata about the GreptimeDB system itself, cluster information, and runtime telemetry for example.

Many `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables have a corresponding `SHOW` command. The benefit of querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is that it is possible to join between tables.

There is still lots of work to do for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. The tracking [issue](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/2931) for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
