# KEY_COLUMN_USAGE

The `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` table describes the key constraints of the columns, such as the time index key constraint.

```sql
USE INFORMATION_SCHEMA;
DESC KEY_COLUMN_USAGE;
```

The output is as follows:

```sql

The description of columns in the `KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` table is as follows:

- `constraint_catalog`: The name of the catalog to which the constraint belongs. The value is always `def`.
- `constraint_schema`: The name of the database to which the constraint belongs.
- `constraint_name`: The name of the constraint.
- `table_catalog`: The name of the catalog to which the table with the constraint belongs. The value is always `def`.
- `real_table_catalog`: The real name of the catalog to which the table with the constraint belongs. The value is always `greptime`.
- `table_schema`: The name of the database to which the table belongs.
- `table_name`: The name of the table with the constraint.
- `column_name`: The name of the column with the constraint.
- `ordinal_position`: The position of the column in the constraint, rather than in the table. The position number starts from `1`.
- `position_in_unique_constraint`: The unique constraint and the primary key constraint are empty. For foreign key constraints, this column is the position of the referenced table's key.
- `referenced_table_schema`: The name of the schema referenced by the constraint. Currently in GreptimeDB, the value of this column in all constraints is `NULL`, except for the foreign key constraint.
- `referenced_table_name`: The name of the table referenced by the constraint. Currently in GreptimeDB, the value of this column in all constraints is `NULL`, except for the foreign key constraint.
- `referenced_column_name`: The name of the column referenced by the constraint. Currently in TiDB, the value of this column in all constraints is `NULL`, except for the foreign key constraint.
