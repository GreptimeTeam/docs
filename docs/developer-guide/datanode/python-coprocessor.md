# Python Coprocessor

## Introduction

Coprocessor, as in TiDB and HBase or Stored Procedure in SQL, is a method to analyze data in local
databases and send it to remote node instead of sending all data to remote node, which then lets
remote do the analysis. This way, a lot of data moving costs are saved. This picture below depicts
how coprocessor works . The `RecordBatch` (Basically a column in table with type and nullability
metadata) can come from anywhere in the database, and returned `RecordBatch` can be annotated in
python grammar to indicate its metadata like type or nullability. Coprocessor will try its best to
convert returned object to a `RecordBatch` , be it a python list, a `RecordBatch` computed from
parameters, or a constant(which is extends to the same length of input arguments)

## Embedded RustPython Interpreter

We are using a experimental python [interpreter](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython) to run
the coprocessor script, it support python 3.10 grammar, but not C API, so no numpy or pandas, but
you can still use all the very pythonic syntax(see [User Guide/Python Coprocessor](/user-guide/python-coprocessor.md) for more!)
