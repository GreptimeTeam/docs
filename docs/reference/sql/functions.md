# Functions

## Datafusion Functions
Since GreptimeDB's query engine is built based on Apache Arrow DataFusion, GreptimeDB inherits all built-in
functions in DataFusion. These functions include:

**Aggregate functions**: such as COUNT(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), etc. For a detailed list, please refer to [Aggregate Functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/aggregate_functions.html)

**Scalar functions**: such as ABS(), COS(), FLOOR(), etc. For a detailed list, please refer to [Scalar Functions](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/sql/scalar_functions.html)

In summary, GreptimeDB supports all SQL aggregate functions and scalar functions in DataFusion. Users can safely
use these rich built-in functions in GreptimeDB to manipulate and analyze data.
