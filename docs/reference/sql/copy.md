# COPY TO

`COPY TO` is used to export the contents of a table to a file.

The syntax for using `COPY TO` is as follows:

```sql
COPY tbl TO '/xxx/xxx/output.parquet' WITH (FORMAT = 'parquet');
```

The command starts with the keyword `COPY`, followed by the name of the table you want to export data from (`tbl` in this case). 

`TO` specifies the file path and name to save the exported
data (`/xxx/xxx/output.parquet` in this case). 

`WITH` adds options such as the file `FORMAT` which specifies the format of the exported file. In this example, the format is Parquet; it is a columnar storage format used for big data processing. Parquet efficiently compresses and encodes columnar data for big data analytics.
