by triggers.

```sql
DESC TABLE INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ALERTS;

The columns in table:
* `trigger_id`: the id of the trigger that generated the alert instance.
* `trigger_name`: the name of the trigger that generated the alert instance.
* `labels`: the key-value pairs associated with the alert instance. And the label
    set uniquely identifies an alert instance.
* `annotations`: the key-value pairs associated with the alert instance.
* `status`: the current status of the alert instance.
* `active_at`: the timestamp when the alert instance became active.
* `fired_at`: the timestamp when the alert instance first entered the `Firing`
    state.
* `resolved_at`: the timestamp when the alert instance was resolved.
* `last_sent_at`: the timestamp when the last notification for the alert instance
    was sent.
