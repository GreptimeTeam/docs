## Highlights of Recent PR 
### [Support for `TQL EXPLAIN` and `TQL ANALYZE` clauses](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/1427)
- `TQL EXPLAIN` (similar to `EXPLAIN` from `SQL`) doesn't execute the query but tells how the query would be executed.
- `TQL ANALYZE` (similar to `ANALYZE` from `SQL`) executes the plan and tells the detailed per-step execution time.

### [Enable Tokio console](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/pull/1512)
With the integration of `tokio-console` and GreptimeDB, as detailed in the [Greptime Developer Guide](https://docs.greptime.com/developer-guide/how-to/how-to-use-tokio-console), all tokio tasks can now be seamlessly displayed. This enhancement significantly aids in troubleshooting issues related to the tokio runtime.

### [Support for additional endpoints in Prometheus HTTP API](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb/issues/1016#issuecomment-1431061736)

In addition to `query` and `query_range` endpoints, as [Prometheus HTTP API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) describes, there are some other useful endpoints which will help Prometheus users to explore the metadata or details of the datasets. These endpoints will facilitate the seamless integration of GreptimeDB into various systems as a Prometheus service.

Here's an example:

```rust
curl 'localhost:9090/api/v1/labels'
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": [
        "__name__",
        "call",
        "code",
        "config",
        "dialer_name",
        "endpoint",
        "event",
        "goversion",
        "handler",
        "instance",
        "interval",
        "job",
        "le",
        "listener_name",
        "name",
        "quantile",
        "reason",
        "role",
        "scrape_job",
        "slice",
        "version"
    ]
}
```

These are the updates of GreptimeDB and we are constantly making progress. We believe that the strength of our software shines in the strengths of each individual community member. Thanks for all your contributions.
