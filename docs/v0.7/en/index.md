GreptimeDB is an open-source time-series database focusing on efficiency, scalability, and analytical capabilities.
It's designed to work on infrastructure of the cloud era, and users benefit from its elasticity and commodity storage.

GreptimeDB is also on cloud as
[GreptimeCloud](https://greptime.com/product/cloud), a fully-managed time-series
database service that features serverless scalability, seamless integration with
ecoystem and improved Prometheus compatibility.

Our core developers have been building time-series data platforms for years. Based on their best-practices, GreptimeDB is born to give you:

- Optimized columnar layout for handling time-series data; compacted, compressed, and stored on various storage backends, particularly cloud object storage with 50x cost efficiency.
- Fully open-source distributed cluster architecture that harnesses the power of cloud-native elastic computing resources.
- Seamless scalability from a standalone binary at edge to a robust, highly available distributed cluster in cloud, with a transparent experience for both developers and administrators.
- Native SQL and PromQL for queries, and Python scripting to facilitate complex analytical tasks.
- Flexible indexing capabilities and distributed, parallel-processing query engine, tackling high cardinality issues down.
- Widely adopted database protocols and APIs, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Prometheus Remote Storage, etc.
- Schemaless writing that automatically creates tables for data.
