# ENGINES

The `ENGINES` table provides provides information about storage engines. This is particularly useful for checking whether a storage engine is supported, or to see what the default engine is.

The `ENGINES` table has the following columns:

* `engine`:  the storage engine name.
* `support`: the level of support for the storage engine:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `YES` | The engine is supported and is active |
| `DEFAULT` | LikeÂ `YES`, plus this is the default engine |
| `NO` | The engine is not supported |
| `DISABLED` | The engine is supported but has been disabled |

* `comment`: A brief description of the storage engine.
* `transactions`: Whether the storage engine supports transactions.
* `xa`: Whether the storage engine supports XA transactions.
* `savepoints`: Whether the storage engine supports savepoints.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ENGINES;
```

The output is as follows:

```sql
+--------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| engine | support | comment                                                                                                                                                            | transactions | xa   | savepoints |
+--------+---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------+------------+
| mito   | DEFAULT | Storage engine for time-series data                                                                                                                                | NO           | NO   | NO         |
| metric | YES     | Storage engine for observability scenarios, which is adept at handling a large number of small tables, making it particularly suitable for cloud-native monitoring | NO           | NO   | NO         |
