# v0.7.0

Release date: March 12, 2024

This is a feature release, read [the release blog](https://www.greptime.com/blogs/2024-03-07-greptimedb-v0.7) to learn more detail about the feature and performance updates.

v0.7 represents a crucial leap toward achieving production readiness; it implements production-ready features for cloud-native monitoring scenarios.

**Highlights**

* Metric Engine: handles a large number of small tables, making it particularly suitable for cloud-native monitoring.
* Region Migration: enhances the user experience and simplifies region migrations with straightforward SQL commands.
* Inverted Index: dramatically improves the efficiency of locating data segments relevant to user queries, significantly reducing the IO operations needed for scanning data files and thus accelerating the query process.
