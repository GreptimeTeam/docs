# Migrate from InfluxDB



## Data model in difference

While you are likely familiar with [InfluxDB key concepts](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/key-concepts/), the [data model](../concepts/data-model.md) of GreptimeDB is something new to explore.
Let's start with similarities and differences:

- Both solutions are [schemaless](/user-guide/write-data/overview#automatic-schema-generation), which means there is no need to define a schema before writing data.
- In InfluxDB, a point represents a single data record with a measurement, tag set, field set, and a timestamp. In GreptimeDB, it is represented as a row of data in the time-series table. The table name corresponds to the measurement, and the columns consist of three types: Tag, Field, and Timestamp.
- GreptimeDB uses `TimestampNanosecond` as the data type for timestamp data from the [InfluxDB line protocol API](/user-guide/write-data/influxdb-line).
- GreptimeDB uses `Float64` as the data type for numeric data from the InfluxDB line protocol API.

Letâ€™s consider the following [sample data](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#sample-data) borrowed from InfluxDB docs as an example:

|_time|_measurement|location|scientist|_field|_value|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2019-08-18T00:00:00Z|census|klamath|anderson|bees|23|
|2019-08-18T00:00:00Z|census|portland|mullen|ants|30|
|2019-08-18T00:06:00Z|census|klamath|anderson|bees|28|
|2019-08-18T00:06:00Z|census|portland|mullen|ants|32|

The InfluxDB line protocol format for the above data is:


```shell
census,location=klamath,scientist=anderson bees=23 1566086400000000000
census,location=portland,scientist=mullen ants=30 1566086400000000000
census,location=klamath,scientist=anderson bees=28 1566086760000000000
census,location=portland,scientist=mullen ants=32 1566086760000000000
```

In GreptimeDB data model the above data be represented as the following in `census` table:

```sql
+----------+-----------+------+---------------------+------+
| location | scientist | bees | ts                  | ants |
+----------+-----------+------+---------------------+------+
| klamath  | anderson  |   23 | 2019-08-18 00:00:00 | NULL |
| klamath  | anderson  |   28 | 2019-08-18 00:06:00 | NULL |
| portland | mullen    | NULL | 2019-08-18 00:00:00 |   30 |
| portland | mullen    | NULL | 2019-08-18 00:06:00 |   32 |
+----------+-----------+------+---------------------+------+
```

The schema of `census` table is as following:

```sql
+-----------+----------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
| Column    | Type                 | Key  | Null | Default | Semantic Type |
+-----------+----------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
| location  | String               | PRI  | YES  |         | TAG           |
| scientist | String               | PRI  | YES  |         | TAG           |
| bees      | Float64              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
| ts        | TimestampNanosecond  | PRI  | NO   |         | TIMESTAMP     |
| ants      | Float64              |      | YES  |         | FIELD         |
+-----------+----------------------+------+------+---------+---------------+
```

## Database connection information

Before writing or querying data, it is important to understand the differences in database connection information between InfluxDB and GreptimeDB.

- Token: The InfluxDB API token is used for authentication and is the same as the GreptimeDB authentication. You can use `<greptimedb_user:greptimedb_password>` as the token when interacting with GreptimeDB using InfluxDB's client libraries or HTTP API.
- Organization: There is no organization when connecting to GreptimeDB.
- Bucket: In InfluxDB, a bucket is a container for time series data. It is the same as the database name in GreptimeDB.

## Write data

GreptimeDB is compatible with InfluxDB's line protocol format, both v1 and v2.
Which means you can easily migrate from InfluxDB to GreptimeDB.

### HTTP API

To write a measurement to GreptimeDB, you can use the following HTTP API request:

Influxdb line protocol v2:

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://<greptimedb-url>:4000/v1/influxdb/api/v2/write?db=<db-name>' \
  -H 'authorization: token <greptime_user:greptimedb_password>' \
  -d 'census,location=klamath,scientist=anderson bees=23 1566086400000000000'
```

Influxdb line protocol v1:

```shell
curl 'http://<greptimedb-url>:4000/v1/influxdb/write?db=<db-name>&u=<greptime_user>&p=<greptimedb_password>' \
  -d 'census,location=klamath,scientist=anderson bees=23 1566086400000000000'
```

### Telegraf

Support of InfluxDB line protocol also means GreptimeDB is compatible with Telegraf.
To configure Telegraf, simply add `http://<greptimedb-url>:4000` URL to Telegraf configs:

::: code-group

```toml [InfluxDB v1]
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://<greptimedb-url>:4000"]
  database = "<db-name>"
  username = "<greptime_user>"
  password = "<greptimedb_password>"
```

```toml [InfluxDB v2]
[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
  urls = ["http://<greptimedb-url>:4000/v1/influxdb"]
  token = "<greptime_user>:<greptimedb_password>"
  bucket = "<db-name>"
  ## Leave empty
  organization = ""
```
