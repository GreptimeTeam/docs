# Overview

## Query Languages

- [PromQL](./promql.md)
- [SQL](./sql.md)

## Client SDK Libraries

Client libraries provide a convenient way to connect to GreptimeDB and interact with data.
They offer functionality for writing and querying data,
making it easier to integrate GreptimeDB into your applications.
For more information, please refer to the [Client Libraries](/user-guide/client-libraries/overview.md) documentation.

## Timezone Settings

As a time-series database, GreptimeDB supports specifying time zones in most query protocols. By specifying a time zone, we can influence the default behavior of data insertion queries.

To learn how to set the time zone in GreptimeDB and understand the effects of setting a time zone on queries and insertions, please refer to [Timezone Settings](./timezone.md).
