# Visualize data

## Introduction

Visualization plays a crucial role in effectively utilizing time series data.

Greptime provides a simple [dashboard](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/dashboard) to help users take advantage of GreptimeDB's various features.

Current version supports MySQL and Python queries (support for PromQL coming soon, stay tuned)

For different scenarios, we provide different chart types to choose from.

We will continue to develop and iterate this open source project, and will increase the application of time series data in monitoring, analysis and other fields in the future.
