# v0.9.0

Release date: July 16, 2024

## üëç Highlights

* [Log Engine](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/logs/overview): GreptimeDB is now a unified time-series database for both metrics, events, and logs (trace in plan).
* [Remote WAL](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/operations/remote-wal/quick-start) is significantly improved and is now recommended to turn on.
* Table View: You can now `CREATE VIEW` on tables and treat them as logical table.
* [Short interval literal](https://docs.greptime.com/reference/sql/data-types#interval-type) for user experience.
* InfluxDB Merge Read: You can now use the `merge_mode=last_non_null` table option to allow SELECT result merges all the last non-null fields.
* gRPC TLS: You can now set up the `grpc.tls` config to turn on TLS for gRPC connection.
* [Manually Compact in Strict Window](https://docs.greptime.com/reference/sql/functions/overview#admin-functions): You can now use `SELECT COMPACT_TABLE("monitor", "strict_window", "3600");` to manually schedule a compaction task, splitting SST files strictly into time windows. The third option is the time window's width in seconds.
