# How to write a gRPC SDK for GreptimeDB

There are two gRPC services exposed by GreptimeDB. One is defined by GreptimeDB, the other is built on top
of [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html). If you want to write a gRPC SDK for
GreptimeDB in a programming language you are familiar with, please read on!

> Currently, the gRPC SDK is written in Java and Go, and you can find more details about
> [Java](/user-guide/client-libraries/java.md) and [Go](/user-guide/client-libraries/go.md).

## `GreptimeDatabase` Service

GreptimeDB defines a custom gRPC service called `GreptimeDatabase`. You can find its protobuf
definitions [here](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptime-proto). It contains two RPC methods:

```protobuf
service GreptimeDatabase {
  rpc Handle(GreptimeRequest) returns (GreptimeResponse);

  rpc HandleRequests(stream GreptimeRequest) returns (GreptimeResponse);
}
```

The `Handle` method is for unary call: when a `GreptimeRequest` is received and processed by a GreptimeDB
server, it responds with a `GreptimeResponse` immediately.

The `HandleRequests` acts in
a "[Client streaming RPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#client-streaming-rpc)" style. It ingests a
stream of `GreptimeRequest`, and handles them on the fly. After all the requests have been handled, it returns a
summarized `GreptimeResponse`. Through `HandleRequests`, we can achieve a very high throughput of requests handling.

However, currently the `GreptimeDatabase` service can **only** handle insert requests. For query requests, we need to
implement the [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) gRPC client as well.

## [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) Service

First, you can find our protobuf definitions for GreptimeDB requests and responses in this [repo](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptime-proto#for-sdk-developers). It is recommended to read the "For SDK developers" section in the README of that repository.

Make sure Arrow Flight RPC officially supports your chosen programming language. Currently, it supports C++, Java, Go, C#, and Rust. However, it may support additional languages in the future, so stay tuned with its [Implementation Status](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/status.html#flight-rpc). If you can't find the language you are using, you have to write a client from sketch (starting from Arrow Flight's raw gRPC service protobuf [definition](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html#protocol-buffer-definitions)).

Now focus on the `DoGet` method of Arrow Flight gRPC service, which all GreptimeDB requests are handled in it.

The `DoGet` method is defined as follow:

```protobuf
  rpc DoGet(Ticket) returns (stream FlightData) {}
```

To send a GreptimeDB request, encode it into raw bytes, then wrap it into a `Ticket` which is a protobuf message carrying bytes:

```protobuf
message Ticket {
  bytes ticket = 1;
}
```

Handling GreptimeDB responses is a little complicated. `DoGet` returns a stream of `FlightData` and the definition of `FlightData` is:

```protobuf
message FlightData {

  /*
   * The descriptor of the data. This is only relevant when a client is
   * starting a new DoPut stream.
   */
  FlightDescriptor flight_descriptor = 1;

  /*
   * Header for message data as described in Message.fbs::Message.
   */
  bytes data_header = 2;

  /*
   * Application-defined metadata.
   */
  bytes app_metadata = 3;

  /*
   * The actual batch of Arrow data. Preferably handled with minimal-copies
   * coming last in the definition to help with sidecar patterns (it is
   * expected that some implementations will fetch this field off the wire
   * with specialized code to avoid extra memory copies).
   */
  bytes data_body = 1000;
}
```

The fields are specified as follow:

- `flight_descriptor` can be ignored here.
- `data_header` must be first deserialized to `Message` (see its definition [here][1]) using [FlatBuffer][2].
  The `Message`'s header type determines how the following two fields are interpreted.
- `app_metadata` carries GreptimeDB's custom data and this field is not empty only after client issues `InsertRequest` or `Insert Into` SQL. When it's not empty, `Message`'s header type is set to `None`. You should deserialize `app_metadata` to `FlightMetadata`. `FlightMetadata` is defined [here](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptime-proto/blob/966161508646f575801bcf05f47ed283ec231d68/proto/greptime/v1/database.proto#L50).
  - `FlightMetadata` only carries "Affected Rows" when writing data into GreptimeDB, just like what "Insert Into" SQL returns in MySQL. If you don't care about the result of the affected rows, you can omit the `app_metadata` field. (Still, the response of `DoGet` itself should be handled as well.)
- When `Message`'s header type is `Schema` or `Recordbatch`, `data_body` carries the actual data of part of the query result. You should parse all the `FlightData`s in the response stream of `DoGet` to get the complete query result. Normally, the first `FlightData` in a stream is schema, and the rests are recordbatch. You should save the first schema for parsing the follow-up `FlightData`s later.

Here we provide a pseudocode for decoding `DoGet`'s `FlightData` stream:

```txt
Context {
  schema: Schema
}

Result {
  affected_rows: int
  recordbatches: List<Recordbatch>
}

function decode_do_get_stream(flight_datas: List<FlightData>) -> Result {
  result = Result
  context = Context

  for flight_data in flight_datas {
    decode(flight_data, context, result);
  }

  return result;
}

function decode(flight_data: FlightData, context: Context, result: Result) {
  message = Message::deserialize(flight_data.data_header);

  switch message.header_type {
    case None:
      flight_metadata = FlightMetadata::deserialize(flight_data.app_metadata);

      result.affected_rows = flight_metadata.affected_rows;

    case Schema:
      context.schema = Schema::deserialize(flight_data.data_body);

    case Recordbatch:
      recordbatch = Recordbatch::deserialize(
        flight_data.data_body,
        context.schema
      );

      result.recordbatches.push(recordbatch);
  }
}
```
