To experience the full power of GreptimeCloud, you need to create a service which contains a database with authentication. Open the [GreptimeCloud console](https://greptime.cloud), signup and login. Then click the `New Service` button and config the following:

* Service Name: The name you want to describe your service.
* Description: More information about your service.
* Region: Select the region where the database is located.
* Plan: Select the pricing plan you want to use.

Now create the service and we are ready to write some metrics to it.
