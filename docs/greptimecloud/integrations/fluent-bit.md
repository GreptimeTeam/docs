# Fluent Bit

Fluent Bit is a lightweight and fast log processor and forwarder that can collect, parse, filter, and forward logs and metrics. Fluent Bit is part of the Fluentd project ecosystem and is written in C language. It is designed to be memory-efficient and performant, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained environments.

## HTTP

Fluent Bit can be configured to send logs to GreptimeCloud using the HTTP protocol. This allows you to collect logs from various sources and send them to GreptimeCloud for storage, analysis, and visualization.

```
[OUTPUT]
    Name             http
    Match            *
    Host             <host>
    Port             443
    Uri              /v1/events/logs?db=<dbname>&table=<table_name>&pipeline_name=<pipeline_name>
    Format           json
    Json_date_key    scrape_timestamp
    Json_date_format iso8601
    Tls              On
    compress         gzip
    http_User        <username>
    http_Passwd      <password>
```

In this example, the `http` output plugin is used to send logs to GreptimeCloud. For more information, and extra options, refer to the [Logs HTTP API](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/logs) guide.

## Prometheus Remote Write

Fluent Bit can be configured to send metrics to GreptimeCloud using the Prometheus Remote Write protocol. This allows you to collect metrics from various sources and send them to GreptimeCloud for storage, analysis, and visualization.

```
[OUTPUT]
    Name                 prometheus_remote_write
    Match                internal_metrics
    Host                 <host>
    Port                 443
    Uri                  /v1/prometheus/write?db=<dbname>
    Tls                  On
    http_user            <username>
    http_passwd          <password>
```

In this example, the `prometheus_remote_write` output plugin is used to send metrics to GreptimeCloud. For more information, and extra options, refer to the [Prometheus Remote Write](https://docs.greptime.com/user-guide/integrations/prometheus) guide.

## OpenTelemetry

Fluent Bit can be configured to send logs and metrics to GreptimeCloud using the OpenTelemetry protocol. This allows you to collect logs and metrics from various sources and send them to GreptimeCloud for storage, analysis, and visualization.

```
# Only for metrics
[OUTPUT]
    Name                 opentelemetry
    Alias                opentelemetry_metrics
    Match                *_metrics
    Host                 <host>
    Port                 443
    Metrics_uri          /v1/otlp/v1/metrics
    http_User            <username>
    http_Passwd          <password>
    Log_response_payload True
    Tls                  On
    compress             gzip

# Only for logs
[OUTPUT]
    Name                 opentelemetry
    Alias                opentelemetry_logs
    Match                *_logs
    Host                 <host>
    Port                 443
    Logs_uri             /v1/otlp/v1/logs
    http_User            <username>
    http_Passwd          <password>
    Log_response_payload True
    Tls                  On
    compress             gzip
    Header X-Greptime-Log-Table-Name "<log_table_name>"
    Header X-Greptime-Log-Pipeline-Name "<pipeline_name>"
    Header X-Greptime-DB-Name "<dbname>"
```

In this example, the [OpenTelemetry OTLP/HTTP API](https://docs.greptime.com/nightly/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/opentelemetry) interface is used. For more information, and extra options, refer to the [OpenTelemetry](https://docs.greptime.com/nightly/user-guide/ingest-data/for-observability/opentelemetry) guide.
